# JohnsonRPokemonAPIChallenge
The original API this project pulls data from can be found at https://pokeapi.co/

This project was built using Tailwind CSS, and allows the user to either search for a specific Pokemon in the search bar, or to get a randomly-selected Pokemon by clicking a button.

The favorites button is not functional at this time, and the only data that populates now is the Pokemon's name and type.
